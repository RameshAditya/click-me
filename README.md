## Announcement time!

I spend a lot of my time writing technical/algorithmic blog posts on my personal blog at https://blogarithms.github.io/

My announcement here, is that I recently pushed a **mailing-list feature** so that I can track my readers and send them emails when I publish new blog posts!

So, if you like algorithms, or competitive programming, or data science, or CS in general, **I'd highly recommend joining my mailing list** to get an update when I push a blog post next.
